    "text":"When it comes to losing weight, there\u2019s no miracle recipe or magic food that melts fat. So, to reach and maintain a healthy weight, you have to change your daily habits\u2026for life! It takes a little effort, time, and perseverance. Simply by moving a little more every day and by trying some of the meal ideas below, you may not only slim your waistline, but you\u2019ll improve your health and daily vitality. Since fruits and vegetables, as well as milk and milk-substitutes, are among the foods most under-consumed by Canadians,[1]make them a priority at snack-time. No matter what or when you eat, it is important to respect your hunger signals and your satiety. Eat only when your body needs to fuel up. And remember that fruits and vegetables should be the focus of your meals. They are very nutritious, so they should make up half of your plate. Meat should be the side dish to your vegetables, not the other way around!  This article has been sponsored by BOOST\u00ae, but all comments and opinions are my own.
